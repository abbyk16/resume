### the great beast

- aleister crowley is SO FUNNY
- or at least this author is74

### choose ur own adventure: space and beyond

- well life moves pretty fast, you're 18 in 2 hours and (at least in my version) you are drafted into the military and become a prisoner of war in about two pages! (it took 10 minutes to get to that ending, and i think i could have ended my adventure much faster if i had put up more of a fight)
- big fan of the disintegrating amoeba aliens though
- star trek brand scifi is the best scifi prove me wrong
